# MySportsRecordIOS
This is a final project in the course CM2001 Mobile Sports Applications and Data Mining at KTH. The app is an ios app that is built on top of the My Sport Record REST service ([MSR REST](https://github.com/asmundur31/My-Sports-Record-REST))


In order for the application to work the MySprotsRecord REST service needs to be running locally and the link here above has that code. At the moment it is private repository.
